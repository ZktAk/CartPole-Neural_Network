Implementation of OpenAI's Gym environment, Cart Pole, solved using a neural network. 

Two versions of the neural network excist in their corrisponding directories:
1. The Raw_Python version is written in raw python without any 3rd part libraries (except for numpy)
2. The Pytorch version is written using Pytorch.

(I know I'm stating the obviouse here, but I don't know what else to put in this README. I'll update this later.)

Run ```python3 main_raw.py``` or ```puthon3 main_torch.py``` to run either version
